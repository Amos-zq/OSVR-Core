# Building the Libraries

You'll need:
- A relatively recent version of Boost
- [libfunctionality][] compiled
- A C++11 capable compiler: VS 2013 is the main one used in development, but theoretically 2012 should work too, and perhaps even 2010. GCC in the nuwen distro of MinGW also works.

For Linux:
- The above (any reasonably recent Clang or GCC is fine), plus `libusb-1.0-0-dev`
